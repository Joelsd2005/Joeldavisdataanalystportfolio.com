      <h2>Tracking US Public Debt Using Excel</h2>
      <p class="meta">March 2025 | Tools: Excel, Forecasting, Charts</p>
      <p>Understanding the dynamics of national debt is essential for shaping fiscal policy, guiding investment decisions, and forecasting economic health. In this project, I created an Excel-based tracker that analyzes the historical trends and future projections of U.S. public debt. The goal was to build a tool for a small debt agency in Washington, D.C., that could answer key financial questions using data from the U.S. Treasury.

Through this tracker, I explored:
How much the debt held by the public has increased each year,
Which months consistently show the largest jumps in debt,
What the next few years might look like based on historical growth patterns

This project highlights how Excel can be used not just for reporting, but for storytelling turning raw numbers into clear, strategic insights. Letâ€™s walk through the process.

      <h2>Cleaning and Exploring Life Expectancy Data with SQL</h2>
      <p class="meta">February 2025 | Tools: SQL, Data Cleaning, EDA</p>
      <p>In this blog, I walk through a hands-on SQL project where I clean and explore the World Life Expectancy dataset sourced from Kaggle. This dataset includes key health and economic indicators for countries around the world from the year 2000 to 2015.

Youâ€™ll learn how I:

Identified and removed duplicate records,
Handled missing values using logical imputation techniques,
Standardized country classifications (Developed vs. Developing),
explored trends in life expectancy, GDP, BMI, and adult mortality.

Using nothing but SQL, this project showcases how powerful and effective query-based data manipulation can be â€” from cleaning the data to uncovering global health patterns and socioeconomic disparities.

Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸ‘‡</p>

      <h2>Building a Business Financial Dashboard in Power BI</h2>
      <p class="meta">January 2025 | Tools: Power BI, DAX, Visualization</p>
      <p>I used Power BI to build a dynamic Business Financial Dashboard to help IT department managers and executives monitor actual spending, budgets, and forecasts across multiple departments, time periods, and countries.

This blog highlights the design, structure, and business value of the dashboard, including visuals that track financial performance, variances, and operational insights across organizational levels.</p>

     <h2>Exploring Movie Genres with Python</h2>
     <p class="meta">April 2025 | Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib</p>
     <p>This project dives into a dataset of movies to uncover trends in genre popularity, distribution over time, and audience ratings. Using Python, I cleaned and analyzed the data with <code>pandas</code> and created visualizations using <code>matplotlib</code> and <code>seaborn</code> to tell the story behind the numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I explored questions such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Which genres are the most commonly produced?</li>
      <li>How have genre trends shifted over the decades?</li>
      <li>Are there genres that consistently receive higher ratings?</li>
    </ul>
    This project showcases my ability to extract insights from unstructured data and communicate findings with clear, compelling visuals â€” skills essential for any data analyst working with consumer or entertainment data.

  <h2>Visualizing Hollywoodâ€™s Most Profitable Films with Tableau</h2>
  <p class="meta">May 2025 | Tools: Tableau, Data Visualization, Score Analysis</p>
  <p>
    In this project, I used Tableau to analyze and visualize trends in film profitability and audience reception across Hollywood. Using a dataset containing movie budgets, gross revenue, and audience scores, I built an interactive dashboard to uncover how success varies by genre, studio, and release year.
  </p>
  <p>
    Key insights include:
    <ul>
      <li>Which films achieved the highest audience scores</li>
      <li>Which studios consistently led in viewer satisfaction</li>
      <li>How worldwide gross profits evolved year over year</li>
    </ul>
    The dashboard empowers users to filter by genre, studio, and release year â€” making it an engaging tool for both industry analysts and film enthusiasts.
