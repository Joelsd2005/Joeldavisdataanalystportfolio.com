      <h2>Tracking US Public Debt Using Excel</h2>
      <p class="meta">March 2025 | Tools: Excel, Forecasting, Charts</p>
      <p>Understanding the dynamics of national debt is essential for shaping fiscal policy, guiding investment decisions, and forecasting economic health. In this project, I created an Excel-based tracker that analyzes the historical trends and future projections of U.S. public debt. The goal was to build a tool for a small debt agency in Washington, D.C., that could answer key financial questions using data from the U.S. Treasury.

Through this tracker, I explored:
How much the debt held by the public has increased each year,
Which months consistently show the largest jumps in debt,
What the next few years might look like based on historical growth patterns

This project highlights how Excel can be used not just for reporting, but for storytelling turning raw numbers into clear, strategic insights. Letâ€™s walk through the process.

      <h2>Cleaning and Exploring Life Expectancy Data with SQL</h2>
      <p class="meta">February 2025 | Tools: SQL, Data Cleaning, EDA</p>
      <p>In this blog, I walk through a hands-on SQL project where I clean and explore the World Life Expectancy dataset sourced from Kaggle. This dataset includes key health and economic indicators for countries around the world from the year 2000 to 2015.

Youâ€™ll learn how I:

Identified and removed duplicate records,
Handled missing values using logical imputation techniques,
Standardized country classifications (Developed vs. Developing),
explored trends in life expectancy, GDP, BMI, and adult mortality.

Using nothing but SQL, this project showcases how powerful and effective query-based data manipulation can be â€” from cleaning the data to uncovering global health patterns and socioeconomic disparities.

Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸ‘‡</p>

      <h2>Building a Business Financial Dashboard in Power BI</h2>
      <p class="meta">January 2025 | Tools: Power BI, DAX, Visualization</p>
      <p>I used Power BI to build a dynamic Business Financial Dashboard to help IT department managers and executives monitor actual spending, budgets, and forecasts across multiple departments, time periods, and countries.

This blog highlights the design, structure, and business value of the dashboard, including visuals that track financial performance, variances, and operational insights across organizational levels.</p>
