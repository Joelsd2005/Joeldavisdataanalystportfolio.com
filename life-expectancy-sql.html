<h1>Cleaning and Exploring Life Expectancy Data with SQL</h1>

<h2>üìö Background</h2>
<p>
The <strong>World Life Expectancy</strong> dataset, available on 
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, 
contains health and economic indicators across more than 180 countries, covering the years 2000 to 2015. 
It includes metrics such as life expectancy, GDP, BMI, status (Developed/Developing), and adult mortality.
Before performing meaningful analysis, it‚Äôs critical to clean this data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
</p>

<h2>üßº Step 1: Data Cleaning</h2>

<h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying and Removing Duplicates</h3>
<p>
To start, we check for duplicate records based on <code>Country</code> and <code>Year</code>:
</p>
<div class="code-box">
<pre><code>SELECT Country, Year, COUNT(*)
FROM worldlifeexpectancy
GROUP BY Country, Year
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
To remove duplicates while retaining one row per <code>Country-Year</code> pair, we use <code>ROW_NUMBER()</code>:
</p>
<div class="code-box">
<pre><code>DELETE FROM worldlifeexpectancy
WHERE Row_ID IN (
  SELECT Row_ID
  FROM (
    SELECT Row_ID,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Country, Year ORDER BY Country) AS Row_Num
    FROM worldlifeexpectancy
  ) AS ranked
  WHERE Row_Num > 1
);</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Missing <code>Status</code> Values</h3>
<p>
Some rows had empty <code>Status</code> fields. We filled these in based on known values from other entries of the same country.
</p>
<div class="code-box">
<pre><code>UPDATE worldlifeexpectancy t1
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy t2
  ON t1.Country = t2.Country
SET t1.Status = t2.Status
WHERE t1.Status = ''
AND t2.Status != '';</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>3Ô∏è‚É£ Estimating Missing Life Expectancy Values</h3>
<p>
For missing life expectancy values, we estimated them using the average of the previous and next year‚Äôs values for the same country:
</p>
<div class="code-box">
<pre><code>UPDATE worldlifeexpectancy t1
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy t2 ON t1.Country = t2.Country AND t1.Year = t2.Year - 1
JOIN worldlifeexpectancy t3 ON t1.Country = t3.Country AND t1.Year = t3.Year + 1
SET t1.`Life expectancy` = ROUND((t2.`Life expectancy` + t3.`Life expectancy`) / 2, 1)
WHERE t1.`Life expectancy` = '';</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>üìä Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

<h3>‚è≥ Life Expectancy Progress Over 15 Years</h3>
<p>
We calculated the improvement in life expectancy for each country between 2000 and 2015.
</p>
<div class="code-box">
<pre><code>SELECT Country,
       MIN(`Life expectancy`) AS Min_Life,
       MAX(`Life expectancy`) AS Max_Life,
       ROUND(MAX(`Life expectancy`) - MIN(`Life expectancy`), 1) AS Increase
FROM worldlifeexpenctancy
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY Increase DESC;</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>üìÜ Global Life Expectancy Trend by Year</h3>
<p>
This query shows the average life expectancy globally for each year.
</p>
<div class="code-box">
<pre><code>SELECT Year, ROUND(AVG(`Life expectancy`), 2) AS Avg_Life_Expectancy
FROM worldlifeexpenctancy
GROUP BY Year
ORDER BY Year;</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>üíµ Relationship Between GDP and Life Expectancy</h3>
<p>
We investigated the relationship between GDP and life expectancy, computing averages per country.
</p>
<div class="code-box">
<pre><code>SELECT Country,
       ROUND(AVG(`Life expectancy`), 2) AS Life_Exp,
       ROUND(AVG(GDP), 1) AS Avg_GDP
FROM worldlifeexpenctancy
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY Avg_GDP DESC;</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
We then segmented countries into low and high GDP brackets (using 1500 as the threshold) to compare life expectancy:
</p>
<div class="code-box">
<pre><code>SELECT 
    AVG(CASE WHEN GDP >= 1500 THEN `Life expectancy` ELSE NULL END) AS High_GDP_Life,
    AVG(CASE WHEN GDP &lt; 1500 THEN `Life expectancy` ELSE NULL END) AS Low_GDP_Life
FROM worldlifeexpenctancy;</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>üåç Developed vs. Developing</h3>
<p>
Next, we compared average life expectancy based on country status:
</p>
<div class="code-box">
<pre><code>SELECT Status, ROUND(AVG(`Life expectancy`), 1) AS Avg_Life
FROM worldlifeexpenctancy
GROUP BY Status;</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>üìâ Rolling Adult Mortality Trends</h3>
<p>
This query calculates a cumulative adult mortality figure over the years for each country:
</p>
<div class="code-box">
<pre><code>SELECT Country, Year, `Life expectancy`, `Adult Mortality`,
       SUM(`Adult Mortality`) OVER(PARTITION BY Country ORDER BY Year) AS Rolling_Total
FROM worldlifeexpenctancy;</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>üß† Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>
This project highlights how SQL can be used not only for data retrieval, but also for powerful data transformation and analysis. By cleaning inconsistencies and filling in missing values, we laid a solid foundation for insights into global health trends. From understanding GDP's impact on life expectancy to identifying progress in developing countries, SQL helped turn raw Kaggle data into meaningful stories.
